==========================  

Language-agnostic URL Shortener developed as cloud-native apps  
_Learning, Making, Sharing..!_  

# How LEARN & MAKE  
Each app/codebase contains its own _README_ for easy onboarding.   

I'll begin with re-implementing uLINK.no's API Server by leveraging different programming languages, and make them as cloud-native apps! 

See list:  
- [Web/Frontend using React.js](ulink-web-reactjs): crafted with React.js, Docker, docker-compose, k8s  
- [API Server using Node.js/FeathersJS](ulink-api-js): crafted with FeathersJS, Docker, docker-compose, k8s  
- [Chrome extension](chrome-extension): crafted as Chrome extension  
- [Mobile App using Flutter/Dart](ulink-mobile-flutter): wip... crafting with Dart lang using Flutter    


# How to SHOW & SHARE     
[uLINK.no](https://www.ulink.no) is full-functional URL shortener service, and is running based on this codebase.   
API is accessible using this [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2611563/RzfZPt3c)
