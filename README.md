Cloud-Native Apps  
===================  

Language-agnostic microservices developed as cloud-native apps  
Learing, Making, Sharing..!  

# How LEARN & MAKE  
Each application contains _README_ for easy onboarding.   
I'll begin with re-implementing BAET.no's API Server by leveraging different programming languages, and make them as cloud-native apps! 
Note: [BAET.no](https://baet.no) is full-functional link shortener service, and is running based on this codebase.  

See list:  
- [using Node.js/FeathersJS](https://github.com/zeusbaba/cloud-native-apps/tree/master/baet-api-js) crafted with FeathersJS, Docker, docker-compose, k8s  
- [using Golang/mux](#)  crafting with Golang, mux, Docker, docker-compose, k8s  


# How to SHOW & SHARE     
_TODO: Link to a functional demo, etc_
